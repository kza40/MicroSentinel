# Tamper-Evident Embedded System

This project is a tamper-evident embedded system built on an Arduino Nano, designed to detect and log unauthorized physical access. It combines motion and magnetic sensors with a lightweight embedded firmware to securely store events, making it ideal for low-power, space-constrained environments.

## üîß Features

- Tamper detection using magnetic and motion-based sensing
- Persistent event logging via I2C-connected memory
- Serial interface for controlled event access
- Low-power footprint suitable for mobile deployments

> ‚ú≥Ô∏è *Some detection thresholds, filtering logic, and response behaviors have been intentionally omitted.*
